# TL:DR
This is a nodejs backend for a card searching website that I am working on - it is currently in its basic implementation, but will hopefully become cooler as time goes on
# necessary tools
Node v14.17.6
# Todo
* json file -> mongodb atlas function
* timed job to grab files from scryfall api and add them to mongodb atlas
* add additional params to current card schema
* frontend
* handle environmental variables (db name)
* write competent readme to allow for users to replicate this
* build api
* tests
